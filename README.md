##bdemeta - build and test BDE-style code

### SYNOPSIS

`bdemeta [--root ROOT] [--cflag NAME:FLAG] [--ldflag NAME:FLAG] [--dependency NAME:DEPENDENCY] MODE ...`<br/>

Where `MODE` is one of:

`bdemeta walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta cflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta ldflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta ninja [-cc CC] [--cxx CXX] [--ar AR] GROUP [GROUP ...]`<br/>
`bdemeta runtests [TEST ...]`:

### DESCRIPTION

`bdemeta` is a set of basic tools to assist building and testing [BDE-style
source trees](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde).  It can generate [ninja build
files](https://github.com/martine/ninja) for a particular package group,
provide `cflags`/`ldflags` (`-I`/`-L/-l` rules respectively by default, along
with any user-supplied ones) when building applications that depend on such
package groups.  It can also run all the unit tests for a particular package
group.

`bdemeta` supports finding package groups across [disconnected
directory structures](#roots), [arbitrary flags](#flags) for any given
dependency, and [dependencies that are not actually package groups](#units).

The contents of `~/.bdemetarc` and `.bdemetarc` will be considered as
command line flags in addition to those specified at invocation.

### INSTALLATION

Platforms running Python 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4 are supported.  Install using `pip`:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/frutiger/bdemeta

**Note**: the script name has changed from `bde-meta` to `bdemeta`.

### OPTIONS

`bdemeta` takes any number of the following options:

  * `--root ROOT`
    Add the specified `ROOT` to the package group search path

  * `--cflag NAME:FLAG`
    Append the specified `FLAG` when generating cflags for the dependency
    with the specified `NAME`.

  * `--ldflag NAME:FLAG`
    Append the specified `FLAG` when generating ldflags for the dependency
    with the specified `NAME`.

  * `--dependency NAME:DEPENDENCY`
    Consider the specified `NAME` to have the specified `DEPENDENCY`.

`bdemeta` runs in one of five modes as given by the first positional argument:

  * `walk GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Walk and topologically sort dependencies

  * `cflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Produce flags for compiling dependents

  * `ldflags GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Produce ldflags for linking dependents

  * `ninja [--cc CC] [--cxx CXX] [--ar AR] GROUP [GROUP ...]`:
    Generate a ninja build file

  * `runtests [TEST ...]`:
    Run BDE-style unit tests

### ROOTS
<a name="roots"></a>

`bdemeta` will look for package groups in directories specified by (possibly
multiple) `--root` arguments.  This makes it easy to build code across multiple
BDE-style repositories, including your own.

### FLAGS
<a name="flags"></a>

Compiler and linker flags may be specified in addition to the ones generated by
the structure of the package group.  These are specified by supplying
`--cflag NAME:FLAG` or `--ldflag NAME:FLAG` where `NAME` specifies the name of
the dependency, and `FLAG` the appropriate cflag/ldflag.  For example,
specifying `--cflag BSL:-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_EXC` will provide that as a flag for
`bsl` and every dependent of `bsl`.

### UNITS
<a name="units"></a>

`bdemeta` supports dependencies that are not package groups (i.e. 'units').
This can be useful when depending on headers and libraries provided by the
system.  By default, such dependencies introduce no new flags unless such a
flag has been specified with a `--cflag NAME:FLAG` or `--ldflag NAME:FLAG`.  In
order to ensure that link lines are correctly topologically sorted, `bdemeta`
will require dependency information that can be specified with `--dependency
NAME:DEPENDENCY`.

### EXAMPLES

The following examples demonstrate working with the ['BDE' source
code](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde) on a Mac OS X with the Xcode
Commandline Tools installed.

First, clone the 'BDE' repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bloomberg/bde

Next, go into your build directory and craft the following `.bdemetarc` file in
that directory:

    $ cd /path/to/build/directory
    $ cat .bdemetarc
    --root /path/to/bde/clone
    --cflag bsl:-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_EXC
    --cflag bsl:-DBDE_BUILD_TARGET_MT
    --cflag bdl+decnumber:-I/path/to/bde/clone/groups/bdl/bdl+decnumber/common

Note that the special 'bdl+decnumber' cflag is needed as that package has
special build rules.

#### Example 1: Building and testing package groups

First, test that the dependencies can be traversed correctly:

    $ bdemeta walk bdl
    bdl bsl

Next, generate generate the ninja build file for `bdl` and all its transitive
dependencies (i.e. `bsl`) into `build.ninja`:

    $ bdemeta ninja bdl > build.ninja

Then, build a static library for just `bsl` into `out/libs`:

    $ ninja bsl

Next, build a static library for `bdl` and each of its transitive dependencies:

    $ ninja bdl

Then, build a specific test driver:

    $ ninja bsls_platform.t

Next, build test drivers for a specific package group:

    $ ninja bsl.t

Then, build test drivers for all package groups:

    $ ninja tests

Next, run a specific test driver:

    $ bdemeta runtests bsls_platform.t

Finally, run all previously built test drivers:

    $ bdemeta runtests

#### Example 2: Building an application package

First, create a root for your application code:

    $ mkdir -p /my/root

Then, create an 'applications' directory inside it.  This will contain all the
application standalone packages.

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications

Next, create a standalone package for your application, called `m_myapp`:

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications/m_myapp

Then, create the metadata for this application:

    $ mkdir /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application
    $ echo 'bsl' > /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application/m_myapp.dep
    $ echo 'myapp.m.cpp' > /my/root/applications/m_myapp/application/m_myapp.mem

Next, go to your build directory:

    $ cd /path/to/build/directory

Then, add your new root to your `.bdemetarc` file:

    $ echo '--root /my/root' >> .bdemetarc

Next, test that the dependencies can be traversed correctly:

    $ bdemeta walk m_myapp
    m_myapp bsl

Then, generate the ninja build file into `build.ninja`:

    $ bdemeta ninja m_myapp > build.ninja

Finally, build your application into `out/apps`:

    $ ninja m_myapp

#### Example 3: Generating cflags for external tools

Some external tools, e.g. 'YouCompleteMe' require a list of cflags.  To
generate valid cflags, simply run the following command:

    $ bdemeta cflags bdl
